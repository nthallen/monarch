/** cic_transmit receives commands from the interactive command
   parser and transmits them as required to the command server
   using the nortlib routine ci_sendcmd(). Commands are only
   actually transmitted if the transmit argument is non-zero.
   Since the client and server share source code, it is easy
   for cmdgen to determine whether a particular command will
   result in an action at the far end.
   
   cic_transmit also keeps track of the command parser states,
   recording the commands required to get to a particular
   state. For example, in the HOX command configuration,
   entering "OH\r" will cause the parser to change to a new
   state (submemu) which expects OH commands. This does
   not require transmission, but it does need to be recorded
   because of the new state. Subsequent commands will be
   transmitted prefixed by the "OH\r" until a "\r" is
   entered, returning the parser to the base state.
   
   The command in buf is not ASCIIZ. Spaces may be represented
   by NULs and the terminating newline should be universally
   represented by a NUL. These must be translated back to
   their original representation before actual transmission.
